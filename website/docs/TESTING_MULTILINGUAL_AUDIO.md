-- Run this query to verify the new column exists:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'blog_posts' 
AND column_name = 'audio_assets_by_language';

-- Test the new functions exist:
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name IN ('get_audio_asset_for_language', 'set_audio_asset_for_language');
```

## 🎭 Act II: The Grand Testing Performance

### 🌟 Test Scenario 1: Creating a New Multi-Language Post

**🎪 The Stage: Admin Panel Post Creation**
1. Go to `/admin/posts/create`
2. Create a new post with content
3. Select **ALL THREE LANGUAGES** for audio generation: ✅ EN ✅ ES ✅ HI
4. Submit and wait for audio generation to complete

**🔍 Expected Results:**
- Post should have separate audio files for each language
- Each language should play its OWN audio (not English for all)
- Database should show entries in `audio_assets_by_language` column

### 🌟 Test Scenario 2: ChatGPT Audio Regeneration  

**🎪 The Stage: ChatGPT Custom GPT**
1. Go to the [Artful Archives Studio Custom GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68709610e134819187ab5967e4f2adff-artful-archives-studio-internal-agent)
2. Ask ChatGPT to regenerate Hindi audio for an existing post
3. Example prompt: *"Regenerate the Hindi audio for the Watkins Glen post"*

**🔍 Expected Results:**
- New Hindi audio should be generated successfully
- The website should now show the NEW Hindi audio (not the old English audio)
- The admin panel should reflect the updated audio

### 🌟 Test Scenario 3: Admin Panel Audio Regeneration

**🎪 The Stage: Admin Tools**
1. Go to `/admin/tools` or the post edit page
2. Find the "Regenerate Audio" option
3. Select a specific language (e.g., Spanish) and regenerate
4. Wait for completion

**🔍 Expected Results:**

1. Open a post that has multiple language audio files
2. The admin sidebar should show:
   - ✅ Available status for languages WITH audio
   - ❌ Missing status for languages WITHOUT audio
   - Correct audio player for each language

**🔍 Expected Results:**
- English plays English audio
- Spanish plays Spanish audio (not English fallback)
- Hindi plays Hindi audio (not English fallback)
- If a language has no audio, it should show "Missing" status

## 🎭 Act III: Debugging the Performance

### 🕵️ Detective Work: Checking the Database

**Query 1: See all audio assets for a post**
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    title,
    primary_audio_id,
    audio_assets_by_language,
    get_audio_asset_for_language(blog_posts, 'en') as english_audio,
    get_audio_asset_for_language(blog_posts, 'es') as spanish_audio,
    get_audio_asset_for_language(blog_posts, 'hi') as hindi_audio
FROM blog_posts 
WHERE title ILIKE '%watkins glen%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Query 2: Check recent audio jobs**
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    status,
    languages,
    audio_urls,
    post_id,
    created_at
FROM audio_jobs 
WHERE status = 'complete'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Query 3: Verify media assets are properly linked**
```sql
SELECT 
    ma.id,
    ma.title,
    ma.file_url,
    ma.metadata->>'language' as language,
    bp.title as post_title
FROM media_assets ma
JOIN blog_posts bp ON ma.related_post_id = bp.id
WHERE ma.file_type = 'audio'
ORDER BY ma.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 🎪 Console Detective Work

**Check the browser console when viewing posts:**
```javascript
// You should see these theatrical logs:
🎯 Found direct es audio asset
🎵 The detective begins his investigation of the Spanish audio mystery...
🎧 Does Spanish have its voice ready?: ✅ Yes!
```

## 🎊 Act IV: The Victory Celebration

**Issue**: *"ChatGPT says 'unauthorized' when checking audio jobs"*  
**Solution**: Verify the external API authentication is working and the Custom GPT has the correct API keys

**Issue**: *"New audio generated but not showing on website"*
**Solution**: Check if the `set_audio_asset_for_language` function was called successfully after audio generation

## 🌟 The Grand Finale
