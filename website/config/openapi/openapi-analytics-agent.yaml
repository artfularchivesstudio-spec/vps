    üîç **AI-Powered Social Media Analytics Platform**
    
    A comprehensive API for retrieving social media metrics and analytics data
    to help understand audience engagement and content performance.
    
    ## **ChatGPT Integration Guide**
    
    This API enables conversational analytics through ChatGPT Actions. The assistant should guide users through intuitive workflows:
    
    ### **Analytics Workflow**
    1. **Retrieve Metrics**: When user asks about social performance, use `getSocialMetrics` to fetch current data
    2. **Interpret Results**: Explain the metrics in user-friendly terms with actionable insights
    3. **Suggest Improvements**: Based on metrics, offer content strategy recommendations
    
    ### **Conversation Patterns**
    
    **üìä Checking Analytics:**
    ```
    User: "How are my social media posts performing?"
    Assistant: [Calls getSocialMetrics] "I've analyzed your social media performance! Here's what I found: Your engagement rate is 3.2% (up 0.5% from last week), with Instagram showing the strongest growth. Would you like specific recommendations to improve your TikTok performance?"
    User: "Yes, what can I do better on TikTok?"
    Assistant: "Based on your metrics, your TikTok videos under 30 seconds have 2x more engagement. Consider creating shorter content focused on trending audio. Your posts at 7-8pm also perform 40% better than morning posts."
    ```
    
    ### **Key Interaction Principles**
    - **Provide context**: Compare metrics to previous periods to show trends
    - **Visualize data**: Describe metrics in terms of percentages and comparisons
    - **Actionable insights**: Always translate raw data into practical recommendations
    - **Handle errors gracefully**: Explain errors in user-friendly terms and suggest solutions
