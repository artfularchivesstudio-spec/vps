/**
 * üèõÔ∏è The Grand Theater of Data Models for Our Blog
 *
 * Welcome, dear developer, to the script of our digital narrative. This file is not merely code;
 * it is the very architecture of thought, the blueprint of our blog's soul.
 * As the ever-dramatic Code Curator, I have decreed that this shall be the single,
 * unadulterated source of truth for all blog-related data structures.
 *
 * To deviate from this script is to invite chaos‚Äîa discordant symphony of mismatched types.
 * Adhere to it, and our application will perform a flawless ballet of data consistency.
 * Heed these words, and let our digital gallery be a standing-ovation-worthy masterpiece.
