# üöÄ Blog Post Loading Fix Documentation

## üìà Issue Overview

The website was experiencing 403 Forbidden errors when attempting to load blog posts. This document explains the root causes and the implemented solutions.

## üéØ Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - The `.env.local` file was missing, causing authentication failures with Supabase
   - Without proper credentials, the API requests were being rejected

2. **Row Level Security (RLS) Configuration Issues**
   - RLS was enabled on the `blog_posts` table without proper public access policies
   - The migration history showed conflicting RLS configurations:
     - Initially disabled with `20250106000008_temporarily_disable_blog_posts_rls.sql`
     - Later re-enabled with `20250714120000_enable_rls.sql` without proper public access policies

3. **PGRST203 Database Errors**
   - These errors indicated permission issues with the PostgreSQL RLS policies
   - The anonymous role didn't have proper permissions to read blog posts

## üí™ Implemented Solutions

### 1. Environment Variables Fix

Created the missing `.env.local` file with proper Supabase credentials based on the `.env.local.example` template.

### 2. RLS Policy Fix

Created a new migration file `20250915000001_fix_blog_posts_public_access.sql` that:

- Ensures RLS is enabled on the `blog_posts` table
- Drops any conflicting policies to avoid permission issues
- Creates a comprehensive policy for public read access to published blog posts
- Adds a policy for authenticated users to read all blog posts regardless of status

```sql
-- Key policy for public access
CREATE POLICY "Public can read published blog posts" 
    ON public.blog_posts
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (status = 'published');
```

### 3. Automation Script

Created a shell script `scripts/fix-blog-access.sh` that:

- Applies the new migration to Supabase
- Restarts the development server
- Provides troubleshooting guidance if issues persist

## üé≠ How to Apply the Fix

1. Ensure you're in the project root directory
2. Run the fix script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/fix-blog-access.sh
   ```
3. If issues persist:
   - Clear your browser cache
   - Restart your browser
   - Check the Supabase dashboard for any RLS policy issues

## üìà Long-term Recommendations

1. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Add better error handling in the blog post fetching functions
   - Implement user-friendly error messages for database connection issues

2. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - Add startup checks to verify required environment variables
   - Provide clear error messages when environment variables are missing

3. **RLS Policy Management**
   - Document all RLS policies in a central location
   - Implement tests to verify RLS policies are working as expected
   - Consider using a policy management tool for complex RLS setups

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. Created `.env.local` with proper Supabase credentials
2. Created `supabase/migrations/20250915000001_fix_blog_posts_public_access.sql`
