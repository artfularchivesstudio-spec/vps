  - Implement proper indexing for performance optimization
  - Set up foreign key relationships and constraints

- **API Architecture**
  - Design RESTful endpoints under `/api/playground/`
  - Implement health monitoring endpoints (`/health`, `/status`)
  - Create testing endpoints (`/test/individual`, `/test/bulk`)
  - Set up WebSocket connections for real-time updates
  - Implement proper error handling and response formatting

### Phase 2: Core Components (Days 3-4)
- **TypeScript Definitions**
  - Define comprehensive interfaces for all data structures
  - Create type-safe configurations for MCP tools and ChatGPT actions
  - Implement utility types for API responses and WebSocket messages

- **Custom Hooks Development**
  - `useHealthMonitoring`: Real-time health data fetching and state management
  - `useTestRunner`: Individual and bulk test execution with progress tracking
  - `useRealTimeUpdates`: WebSocket connection management and message handling

### Phase 3: User Interface (Days 5-6)
- **Dashboard Components**
  - `HealthOverview`: System health summary with visual indicators
  - `ComponentGrid`: Interactive grid showing all AI integrations status
  - `TestRunner`: Individual component testing interface
  - `BulkTestRunner`: Multi-component testing orchestration
  - `RealTimeUpdates`: Live notifications and status updates panel

- **Analytics & History**
  - `MetricsDashboard`: Performance analytics with charts and trends
  - `TestHistory`: Historical data with advanced filtering and export

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Days 7-8)
- **Real-time Features**
  - WebSocket integration with Supabase Realtime
  - Live status updates and notifications
  - Auto-refresh mechanisms with configurable intervals

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
  - Optimize database queries with proper indexing
  - Add loading states and error boundaries

## 5. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: WebSocket Connection Instability**
- *Impact*: High - Real-time updates may fail
- *Probability*: Medium
- *Mitigation*: Implement automatic reconnection logic, fallback to polling, connection health monitoring

**Risk 2: Database Performance Issues**
- *Impact*: High - Slow dashboard loading and poor user experience
- *Probability*: Medium
- *Mitigation*: Proper indexing strategy, query optimization, caching layer, database monitoring

**Risk 3: MCP Server/ChatGPT API Rate Limiting**
- *Impact*: Medium - Testing functionality may be throttled
- *Probability*: High
- *Mitigation*: Implement rate limiting in testing logic, queue management, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

**Risk 4: TypeScript Type Complexity**
- *Impact*: Low - Development velocity may decrease
- *Probability*: Medium
- *Mitigation*: Incremental type implementation, comprehensive documentation, regular code reviews

### Operational Risks

**Risk 5: Scope Creep**
- *Impact*: High - Project timeline extension
- *Probability*: Medium
- *Mitigation*: Clear requirements documentation, regular milestone reviews, feature prioritization matrix

**Risk 6: Integration Complexity**
- *Impact*: Medium - Delayed integration with existing systems
- *Probability*: Medium
- *Mitigation*: Early integration testing, modular architecture, comprehensive API documentation

**Risk 7: Performance Under Load**
- *Impact*: High - System may not handle concurrent users
- *Probability*: Low
- *Mitigation*: Load testing, performance monitoring, scalable architecture design, caching strategies

### Contingency Plans

1. **Fallback UI**: If real-time features fail, implement polling-based updates
2. **Simplified Testing**: If bulk testing proves complex, focus on robust individual testing
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality first, advanced features as time permits
4. **Mock Data**: Comprehensive mock data for development and testing when external APIs are unavailable
