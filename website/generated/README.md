# 🎭 The Generated Types Theater - Where Code Becomes Art! ✨

*Welcome to our mystical realm of auto-generated types and magical client libraries!*

## 🎪 What Lives Here?

This enchanted directory houses the fruits of our type generation sorcery:

### 📁 `/prisma/` - The Database Oracle's Gifts
- **Purpose**: Auto-generated Prisma Client for database operations
- **Generated by**: `npm run prisma:generate`
- **Magic Source**: `/prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Usage**: Import with `import { PrismaClient } from '../generated/prisma'`

### 📁 `/openapi-types/` - The API Type Scrolls
- **Purpose**: TypeScript types generated from OpenAPI specifications
- **Generated by**: `npm run types:generate`
- **Magic Source**: `/config/openapi/openapi.yaml`
- **Usage**: Import with `import type { ApiTypes } from '../generated/openapi-types/api-types'`

## 🎬 The Generation Commands

```bash
# 🎭 Generate all the magical types
npm run types:generate     # OpenAPI → TypeScript types
npm run prisma:generate    # Prisma schema → Database client

# 🎪 Watch for changes and auto-regenerate
npm run types:watch        # Watches OpenAPI specs for changes

# 🚀 The full development experience
npm run dev:full          # Generate everything + start dev server
```

## 🎨 The Theatrical Rules

1. **🚫 Never Edit Manually**: These files are conjured by scripts, not human hands!
2. **🔄 Regenerate Often**: When you change specs or schemas, regenerate the types
3. **📚 Import Wisely**: Always import from the generated directory, never from source
4. **🎭 Embrace the Magic**: Let the automation handle the tedious type work

## 🌟 Pro Tips for Type Wizards

- **Version Control**: Add `/generated/` to `.gitignore` if types are large
- **CI/CD**: Run generation commands in your build pipeline
- **Development**: Use `npm run dev:full` for the complete setup experience
- **Debugging**: Check the source files if generated types seem wrong
