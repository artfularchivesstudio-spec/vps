    üé≠ **Spellbinding AI-Powered Content Creation Platform**
    
    A comprehensive API for ChatGPT Actions featuring mystical Museum Director personas, 
    multilingual audio narration with magical enhancement, and complete content management workflows.
    
    ## **ChatGPT Integration Guide**
    
    This API enables conversational content management through ChatGPT Actions. The assistant should guide users through intuitive workflows:
    
    ### **Blog Post Creation Workflow**
    1. **Image to Blog**: When user uploads artwork, use `createBlogFromImage` to generate complete blog content
    2. **Save as Draft**: Use the generated content with `createPost` to save as draft
    3. **Audio Generation**: Offer to generate multilingual audio narration using `generateAudio`
    4. **Publishing Decision**: Ask user if they want to publish or keep as draft using `updatePost`
    
    ### **Conversation Patterns**
    
    **üé® Creating Blog Posts:**
    ```
    User: "I have an artwork image to create a blog post about"
    Assistant: "I'd love to help you create a blog post! Please upload your artwork image and I'll create engaging content from it."
    [User uploads image]
    Assistant: [Calls createBlogFromImage] "I've analyzed your artwork and created a complete blog post! Here's the title, content, and metadata I generated... [shows results]. Would you like me to save this as a draft in your blog?"
    User: "Yes, save it as a draft"
    Assistant: [Calls createPost with the generated content] "Perfect! I've saved your blog post as a draft. Would you like me to generate an audio narration for this post?"
    User: "Yes, generate audio in English and Spanish"
    Assistant: [Calls generateAudio] "I've started generating audio in English and Spanish! The job ID is [ID]. Would you like to publish this post now or keep it as a draft?"
    ```
    
    **üéµ Audio Management:**
    ```
    User: "How is my audio generation going?"
    Assistant: [Calls getAudioJobStatus] "Your audio job is [status]. [If completed] The audio files are ready! Would you like to listen to them or update the post?"
    
    User: "The Spanish audio sounds like it's still in English"
    Assistant: [Calls regenerateLanguageAudio with language="es"] "I've queued regeneration for the Spanish audio. This will create a new Spanish narration with proper translation. I'll check the status in a moment."
    
    User: "Regenerate just the Hindi audio with better quality"
    Assistant: [Calls regenerateLanguageAudio with language="hi"] "I've started regenerating just the Hindi audio while keeping your English and Spanish versions intact. The new Hindi narration will be ready shortly."
    ```
    
    **üìù Content Management:**
    ```
    User: "Show me my recent posts"
    Assistant: [Calls listPosts] "Here are your recent posts: [list]. Would you like to edit, publish, or create audio for any of these?"
    User: "Edit the second one"
    Assistant: [Calls getPost] "Here's the current content: [content]. What would you like to change?"
    User: "Update the title to..."
    Assistant: [Calls updatePost] "I've updated your post! The new title is '[title]'. Would you like to generate new audio to match the updated content?"
    ```
    
    ### **Key Interaction Principles**
    - **Always confirm actions**: Ask before publishing, deleting, or making major changes
    - **Provide status updates**: Keep users informed about job progress and completion
    - **Offer next steps**: After each action, suggest relevant follow-up actions
    - **Handle errors gracefully**: Explain errors in user-friendly terms and suggest solutions
    - **Context awareness**: Remember previous actions in the conversation for smoother flow
